## Motivation:
### Gain an insight of latest spread trends in the NFL
#### Spreads refer to gambling lines. There are two main spreads focused on in this analysis
- Points line: how many points one team is favored over another
- Over/Under line: How many total points scored in the game

## Data
### Data was downloaded from kaggle 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data

### Process
#### There were multiple steps to this project:
1. Download raw data into Jupyter notebook
2. Use Jupyter notebooks to explore and clean data
3. Process and feature engineer variables to analyze spread
4. Save final dataframe with all relevant spread variables
5. Use .py file to build relevant dataframes for spread analysis
6. Utilize streamlit within .py file to build UI to showcase analysis

### Deployment
#### streamlit was used to publish site that can easily show case spread analysis from multiple angles
